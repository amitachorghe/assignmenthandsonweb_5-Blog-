            A daily roundup of news and information about Bitcoin, Ethereum,
            Dogecoin and more, this page has everything you need to know about
            cryptocurrency. The pricing of cryptocurrency changes very
            frequently and remains highly volatile. Even looking at only the
            most well-known crypto tokens such as Bitcoin, Ether (not to be
            confused with the Ethereum network for which it is the native
            token), Dogecoin, Litecoin and Ripple, there has been a lot of
            movement in their value. Bitcoin is the oldest and most well-known
            crypto token that you can buy, and in the last 24-hours, its value
            has changed by -1.75%. It was priced at ₹38,62,196, according to
            CoinSwitch, and is now at ₹37,94,590. Bitcoin’s market cap is now
            ₹67.5T.

            Cryptocurrency is a digital payment system that doesn't rely on
            banks to verify transactions. It’s a peer-to-peer system that can
            enable anyone anywhere to send and receive payments. Instead of
            being physical money carried around and exchanged in the real world,
            cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries to an online
            database describing specific transactions. When you transfer
            cryptocurrency funds, the transactions are recorded in a public
            ledger. Cryptocurrency is stored in digital wallets. Cryptocurrency
            received its name because it uses encryption to verify transactions.
            This means advanced coding is involved in storing and transmitting
            cryptocurrency data between wallets and to public ledgers. The aim
            of encryption is to provide security and safety.

            Bitcoin is a digital currency that was created in January 2009, and
            it's one of the first and most well-known forms of crytpocurrency:
            virtual money secured by cryptography. It's built on a technology
            called the Blockchain, and for several years, the two concepts were
            almost synonymous. Strangely, although Bitcoin is the most
            well-known cryptocurrency, its creator is still unknown. Someone
            with the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto released a whitepaper that would
            become Bitcoin.
